  <h3>Research</h3>
  <div class="research">
	<h4>Lecturers adapting to flipped teaching</h4>
		<p>I am currently conducting a research project into lecturers' experiences adapting to flipped teaching with my co-investigator (and supervisor) Barbara Kensington-Miller from the University of Auckland. This project received ethics approval from the University of Auckland and data collection was conducted in May 2018. Data analysis is complete and the project is currently being written up to submit for publication.</p>
	<br>
	<h4>William Pike Challenge Award evaluation</h4>
		<p>I was a member of the research team that evaluated the outcomes of the William Pike Challenge Award programme, a youth development initiative for adolescents delivered in a number of schools in New Zealand. I conducted data collection (interviews), participated in the data analysis (themes and coding), and contributed to the write up.</p>

	<br>
	<h4>Gender and Health</h4>
		<p>I worked on several projects as a research assistant at the Centre for Women, Gender and Health at the University of Melbourne. The main projects I contributed to were a study into the acceptability of different long acting reversible contraception methods to clinicians and patients in Australia, and a study on paid parental leave and ‘baby bonus’ payments in Australia and parents’ experiences of these government payments. I conducted data collection (interviews and phone questionnaires), managed participant records, and contributed to data analysis.</p>
	<br>
	<h4>Student research supervision</h4>
		<p>In my capacity as health promotion lecturer at Unitec I supervised four student research projects for final-year students. These projects addressed alcohol regulation, sexual health service delivery, and community health programming in New Zealand.</p>
	<br>
	<h4>Masters research project on HIV programming</h4>
		<p>For the research component of my Master of Public Health I undertook a literature review of HIV programming for men who have sex with men in sub-Saharan Africa. I reviewed the health programming targeted at this demographic across the continent, and the barriers and facilitators to delivering HIV prevention and treatment services for this vulnerable population. </p>
