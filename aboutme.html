	<div id="about_me">
		<p><img id="about_me_pic" src="professional-pic-horizontal.jpg">I am a higher education teacher, adult educator, and researcher originally from New Zealand. I have been studying, teaching and working in public health since 2009.</p>
		<p>I completed my Master of Public Health at the University of Melbourne in Australia in 2012. After graduating I became a tutor on the programme. I was then appointed as a sessional lecturer in health promotion at the Australian Catholic University. In 2015 I took up a permanent position as lecturer in health promotion at Unitec Institute of Technology in Auckland, New Zealand, and was promoted to senior lecturer in 2018.</p>
		<p>My areas of interest are sexual health, global health, health promotion, health education, health programmes, programme evaluation, adult education, and higher education teaching.</p>
